# Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game in Python. The game allows the user to play against the computer by choosing one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. Additionally, the user has the choice to play multiple rounds or exit the game whenever they want.

## Features

- Player vs. Computer gameplay
- Randomized computer choices
- User input validation
- Option to play multiple rounds or exit the game
- Simple command-line interface

## How to Play

1. Run the game script using Python:

   ```bash
   python RockPaperScissors.py
   ```

2. The game will prompt you to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

3. After you make your choice, the computer will randomly choose its move.

4. The game will determine the winner based on the rules:
   - Rock crushes scissors
   - Scissors cut paper
   - Paper covers rock

5. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'yes' to continue playing or 'no' to exit the game.

- Python 3.x
